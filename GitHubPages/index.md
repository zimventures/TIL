# Intro
Well, this is quite meta. The first article in TIL will be about setting up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Not coincidentally, it's the platform I'm typing this on right now. 
GitHub Pages allows you to easily host a website powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). With GitHub's [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) feature, you don't even 
need to setup a local development environment in order to work on your site. Everything is magically in the cloud! ‚òÅ


# Goal
At the end of this tutorial series I'll have setup the guts of the TIL website on GitHub Pages, all using a remote Codespaces development environment. 

# Our TODO List
During each step along the way, a tutorial will be written detailing what I learned.

- [x] [EZ-mode remote development](/GitHubPages/codespaces)
- [ ] Customizing a "stock" GitHub Jekyl theme
- [ ] Using Liquid to Build a Navigation Menu
- [ ] Adding a Blog section
- [ ] Adding a "latest posts" section to the landing page
